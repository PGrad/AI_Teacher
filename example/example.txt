Once upon a time, there were two teenage girls: Koki and Tia. Koki was a shy but independent girl while Tia was a jolly, sporty girl. They were classmates and had made good friends with each other.

One day Koki planted an idea to Tia- let's go on an adventure and explore our state! Tia was more than happy to accept the idea and they started to explore their state. They visited different cities, learning about the culture and making many memories.

A few days later, they reached their destination- the peak of the highest mountain in their state. As they watched the beautiful sunset, they made a promise to each other that theyâ€™d be best friends forever.
